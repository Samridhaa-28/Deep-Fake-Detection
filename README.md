# Deep-Fake-Detection
DeepFake Detection using CNN + LSTM | A PyTorch-based model to detect DeepFakes in videos by analyzing spatial and temporal features. Includes real-time Streamlit interface, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Promotes awareness against misinformation and digital manipulation.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable system to classify videos as either real or deepfake. The system processes video frames using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies across frames.
